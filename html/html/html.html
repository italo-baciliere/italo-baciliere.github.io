    <h1>Acessibilidade</h1>
    <p>
        "Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, 
        navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup</li>
        <li>ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content</li>
        <li>create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly</li>                
    </ol>    
    

    <h2>Add a text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Alt</span> text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where
        the image fails to load or cant'n be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains 
        to include it in search results. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/accessibility2.png" alt="accessibility icon"/> <!-- https://icons8.com/icon/23620/web-accessibility -->
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="2" cols="50" wrap="off" readonly>
        <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/accessibility2.png" alt="accessibility icon"/>
    </textarea>
    <p>You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.</p>

    <p>In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, 
        the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:
    </p>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="2" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        <img src="background.png" alt=""/>
    </textarea>


    <h2>Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content</h2>
    <p>
        Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. 
        Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. 
        This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, 
        not be picked merely for their size values.
    </p>
    <p>Headings Hierarchy</p>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="7" cols="20" wrap="off" readonly>

        <h1></h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <h5></h5>
        <h6></h6>
    </textarea>


    <h2>semantic tags</h2>
    <p>
        HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. 
        These tags include <span>main</span>, <span>header</span>, <span>footer</span>, <span>nav</span>, <span>article</span>, 
        and <span>section</span>, among others.
    </p>
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="4" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>        
        <html>
            <header>

            </header>

            <body>
                <header></header>
                <main></main>
                <footer></footer>

            </body>
        </html>        
    </textarea>


    <h3>Note About <span>section</span> and <span>div</span></h3>
    <p>
        The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. 
        An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. 
        They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. 
        When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.
    </p>
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="5" cols="60" wrap="off" readonly>

        <div> - groups content
        <section> - groups related content
        <article> - groups independet, self-contained content
    </textarea>

    

    <h2>Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element</h2>

    <p>HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. 
        Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. 
        This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.
    </p>
    <p>The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. 
        This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example:</p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="/resources/audio/criolo-aprendiz.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="4" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="/resources/audio/criolo-aprendiz.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>    
    </textarea>



    <h2>Improve Form Field Accessibility with the lavel Element</h2>
    <p>Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names as well as attributes. 
        The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.</p>
    <p>The <span>label</span> tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. 
        This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. 
        The <span>for</span> attribute on a <span>label</span> tag explicitly associates that <span>label</span> with the form control and is used by screen readers.</p>
    <form>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name">
    </form>
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="6" cols="40" wrap="off" readonly>

        <form>
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name">
        </form>
    </textarea>

    

    <h2>Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for Better Accessibility</h2>
    <p>The next form topic covers accessibility of radio buttons. 
        Each choice is given a <span>label</span> with a <span>for</span> attribute tying to the <span>id</span> of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. 
        Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.</p>
    <p>The <span>fieldset</span> tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a <span>legend</span> tag to provide a description for the grouping, 
        which is read by screen readers for each choice in the <span>fieldset</span> element.</p>
    <p>Here's an example:</p>
    <form>
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
          <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
          <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
          <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
          <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
          <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
          <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
      


    <!--
    <label for="">Textarea</label>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="4" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        It was a dark and stormy night...
        <html></html>        
    </textarea>
    -->
