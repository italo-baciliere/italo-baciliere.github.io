    <h1>Acessibilidade</h1>
    <p>
        "Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, 
        navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup</li>
        <li>ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content</li>
        <li>create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly</li>                
    </ol>    
    

    <h2>Add a text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Alt</span> text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where
        the image fails to load or cant'n be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains 
        to include it in search results. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/accessibility2.png" alt="accessibility icon"/> <!-- https://icons8.com/icon/23620/web-accessibility -->
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="2" cols="50" wrap="off" readonly>
        <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/accessibility2.png" alt="accessibility icon"/>
    </textarea>
    <p>You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.</p>

    <p>In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, 
        the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:
    </p>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="2" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        <img src="background.png" alt=""/>
    </textarea>


    <h2>Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content</h2>
    <p>
        Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. 
        Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. 
        This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, 
        not be picked merely for their size values.
    </p>
    <p>Headings Hierarchy</p>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="7" cols="20" wrap="off" readonly>

        <h1></h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <h5></h5>
        <h6></h6>
    </textarea>


    <h2>semantic tags</h2>
    <p>
        HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. 
        These tags include <span>main</span>, <span>header</span>, <span>footer</span>, <span>nav</span>, <span>article</span>, 
        and <span>section</span>, among others.
    </p>
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="4" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>        
        <html>
            <header>

            </header>

            <body>
                <header></header>
                <main></main>
                <footer></footer>

            </body>
        </html>        
    </textarea>


    <h3>Note About <span>section</span> and <span>div</span></h3>
    <p>
        The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. 
        An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. 
        They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. 
        When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.
    </p>
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="5" cols="60" wrap="off" readonly>

        <div> - groups content
        <section> - groups related content
        <article> - groups independet, self-contained content
    </textarea>

    <label for="">Textarea</label>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="4" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        It was a dark and stormy night...
        <html></html>        
    </textarea>
