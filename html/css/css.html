    <h1>introduction to the responsive web design challenges</h1>

    <p>Today, there are many types of devices that can access the web. 
        They range from large desktop computers to small mobile phones. 
        These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power. 
        Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices.</p>

    <h2>create a media query</h2>
    
    <p>Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. 
        The viewport is a user's visible area of a web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site.</p>
    <p>Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, 
        the styles are applied. You can have as many selectors and styles inside your media query as you want.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of a media query that returns the content when the device's width is less than or equal to 100px:</p>
    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="3" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        
        @media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }
    </textarea>

    <p>and the following media query returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px:</p>

    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="3" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        
        @media (min-height: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }
    </textarea>


    <!--
    <label for="">Textarea</label>    
    <textarea id="" name="textarea" rows="4" cols="30" wrap="off" readonly>
        It was a dark and stormy night...
        <html></html>        
    </textarea>
    -->
